<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Project Owl is a proof of concept AI powered application that aims to demonstrate how the Expert AI Natural Language API can be used for auditing and gaining insight from customers by analyzing audio recorded calls at call centers. Project Owl employs the Sentiment Analysis and Taxonomy features of the NLP API to analyse and prioritize customer service complaints and also provides insight on the customer emotional state respectively. 

The inspiration for this project is to experiment how a call center issue management system can be automated for customer serving financial institutions such as banks and fin-tech companies.
